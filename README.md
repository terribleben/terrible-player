## terrible-player

This app plays media from the device's local iTunes library and optionally scrobbles it to last.fm.

The only reason to use this is if you really like last.fm and mostly play music from the device's media library (rather than using a streaming service). You will need to provide your own last.fm API key in `config.plist`.
