Cartridge
=========
Cartridge (working title) is a music player for iOS that contains only features I will use.

That includes:
- Playing albums from the iTunes library on the device's hard disk
- Scrobbling plays to last.fm

It doesn't include:
- Anything related to iCloud
- Playlists, genres, radio, etc.
- Ads
- Crap

To build:
- Clone the repo
- pod install
- You'll need to add your own config.plist containing a last.fm API key
