 *  Listen to music library change events and application state changes.
 *  This class initiates a looping, silent audio task whenever there is system music playing,
 *  so that iOS doesn't terminate the app in the background and we continue receiving system
 *  notifications while in the background.
 *
 *  The audio task will be terminated when music stops in order to conserve battery.
